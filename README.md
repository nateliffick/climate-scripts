Hello Everyone!

My name is nate, I am trying to become proficient in python and eventually land a job in it!
I have worked in the finance world but I am currently receiving my masters in Environmental monitoring for management (done in september) where I have been using python!
If you would like to speak about opprotunities or give feedback please let me know!
